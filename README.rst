A Python3 library implementing an interface for ev3dev_ devices,
letting you control motors, sensors, hardware buttons, LCD
displays and more from Python code.

If you haven't written code in Python before, you'll need to learn the language
before you can use this library.

Getting Started
---------------

This library runs on ev3dev_. Before continuing, make sure that you have set up
your EV3 or other ev3dev device as explained in the `ev3dev Getting Started guide`_.
Make sure you have an ev3dev-stretch version greater than ``2.2.0``. You can check
the kernel version by selecting "About" in Brickman and scrolling down to the
"kernel version". If you don't have a compatible version, `upgrade the kernel before continuing`_.

Usage
-----

To start out, you'll need a way to work with Python. We recommend the
`ev3dev Visual Studio Code extension`_. If you're interested in using that,
check out our `Python + VSCode introduction tutorial`_ and then come back
once you have that set up.

Otherwise, you can can work with files `via an SSH connection`_ with an editor
such as `nano`_, use the Python interactive REPL (type ``python3``), or roll
your own solution. If you don't know how to do that, you are probably better off
choosing the recommended option above.

The template for a Python script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every Python program should have a few basic parts. Use this template
to get started:

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   from ev3dev2.motor import LargeMotor, OUTPUT_A, OUTPUT_B, SpeedPercent, MoveTank
   from ev3dev2.sensor import INPUT_1
   from ev3dev2.sensor.lego import TouchSensor
   from ev3dev2.led import Leds

   # TODO: Add code here

The first line should be included in every Python program you write
for ev3dev. It allows you to run this program from Brickman, the graphical
menu that you see on the device screen. The other lines are import statements
which give you access to the library functionality. You will need to add
additional classes to the import list if you want to use other types of devices
or additional utilities.

You should use the ``.py`` extension for your file, e.g. ``my-file.py``.

If you encounter an error such as ``/usr/bin/env: 'python3\r': No such file or directory``,
you must switch your editor's "line endings" setting for the file from "CRLF" to just "LF".
This is usually in the status bar at the bottom. For help, see `our FAQ page`_.

Important: Make your script executable (non-Visual Studio Code only)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To be able to run your Python file, **your program must be executable**. If
you are using the `ev3dev Visual Studio Code extension`_, you can skip this step,
as it will be automatically performed when you download your code to the brick.

**To mark a program as executable from the command line (often an SSH session),
run** ``chmod +x my-file.py``.

You can now run ``my-file.py`` via the Brickman File Browser or you can run it
from the command line by preceding the file name with ``./``: ``./my-file.py``

Controlling the LEDs with a touch sensor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This code will turn the LEDs red whenever the touch sensor is pressed, and
back to green when it's released. Plug a touch sensor into any sensor port before
trying this out.

.. code-block:: python

  ts = TouchSensor()
  leds = Leds()

  print("Press the touch sensor to change the LED color!")

  while True:
      if ts.is_pressed:
          leds.set_color("LEFT", "GREEN")
          leds.set_color("RIGHT", "GREEN")
      else:
          leds.set_color("LEFT", "RED")
          leds.set_color("RIGHT", "RED")

If you'd like to use a sensor on a specific port, specify the port like this:

.. code-block:: python

  ts = TouchSensor(INPUT_1)

Running a single motor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This will run a LEGO Large Motor at 75% of maximum speed for 5 rotations.

.. code-block:: python

  m = LargeMotor(OUTPUT_A)
  m.on_for_rotations(SpeedPercent(75), 5)

You can also run a motor for a number of degrees, an amount of time, or simply
start it and let it run until you tell it to stop. Additionally, other units are
also available. See the following pages for more information:

- http://python-ev3dev.readthedocs.io/en/ev3dev-stretch/motors.html#ev3dev.motor.Motor.on_for_degrees
- http://python-ev3dev.readthedocs.io/en/ev3dev-stretch/motors.html#units

Driving with two motors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest drive control style is with the `MoveTank` class:

.. code-block:: python

    tank_drive = MoveTank(OUTPUT_A, OUTPUT_B)

    # drive in a turn for 5 rotations of the outer motor
    # the first two parameters can be unit classes or percentages.
    tank_drive.on_for_rotations(SpeedPercent(50), SpeedPercent(75), 10)
    
    # drive in a different turn for 3 seconds
    tank_drive.on_for_seconds(SpeedPercent(60), SpeedPercent(30), 3)

There are also `MoveSteering` and `MoveJoystick` classes which provide different
styles of control. See the following pages for more information:

- http://python-ev3dev.readthedocs.io/en/ev3dev-stretch/motors.html#multiple-motor-groups
- http://python-ev3dev.readthedocs.io/en/ev3dev-stretch/motors.html#units

Using text-to-speech
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to make your robot speak, you can use the ``Sound.speak`` method:

.. code-block:: python

  from ev3dev2.sound import Sound

  sound = Sound()
  sound.speak('Welcome to the E V 3 dev project!')

Make sure to check out the `User Resources`_ section for more detailed
information on these features and many others.

Using Micropython
-----------------

Normal Python too slow? Try `Micropython`_ if it supports the features your
project needs.
