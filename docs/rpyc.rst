Working with ev3dev remotely using RPyC
=======================================

RPyC_ (pronounced as are-pie-see), or Remote Python Call, is a transparent
python library for symmetrical remote procedure calls, clustering and
distributed-computing. RPyC makes use of object-proxying, a technique that
employs pythonâ€™s dynamic nature, to overcome the physical boundaries between
processes and computers, so that remote objects can be manipulated as if they
were local. Here are simple steps you need to follow in order to install and
use RPyC with ev3dev:

1. Install RPyC both on the EV3 and on your desktop PC. For the EV3, enter the
   following command at the command prompt (after you `connect with SSH`_):

   .. code-block:: shell

       sudo easy_install3 rpyc

   On the desktop PC, it really depends on your operating system. In case it is
   some flavor of linux, you should be able to do

   .. code-block:: shell

       sudo pip3 install rpyc

   In case it is Windows, there is a win32 installer on the project's
   `sourceforge page`_. Also, have a look at the `Download and Install`_ page
   on their site.

2. Create file ``rpyc_server.sh`` with the following contents on the EV3:

   .. code-block:: shell

      #!/bin/bash
      python3 `which rpyc_classic.py`

   and make the file executable:

   .. code-block:: shell

      chmod +x rpyc_server.sh

   Launch the created file either from SSH session (with
   ``./rpyc_server.sh`` command), or from brickman. It should output something
   like

   .. code-block:: none

      INFO:SLAVE/18812:server started on [0.0.0.0]:18812

   and keep running.

3. Now you are ready to connect to the RPyC server from your desktop PC. The
   following python script should make a large motor connected to output port
   ``A`` spin for a second.

   .. code-block:: py

       import rpyc
       conn = rpyc.classic.connect('ev3dev') # host name or IP address of the EV3
       ev3 = conn.modules['ev3dev.ev3']      # import ev3dev.ev3 remotely
       m = ev3.LargeMotor('outA')
       m.run_timed(time_sp=1000, speed_sp=600)

You can run scripts like this from any interactive python environment, like
ipython shell/notebook, spyder, pycharm, etc.

Some *advantages* of using RPyC with ev3dev are:

* It uses much less resources than running ipython notebook on EV3; RPyC server
  is lightweight, and only requires an IP connection to the EV3 once set up (no
  ssh required).
* The scripts you are working with are actually stored and edited on your
  desktop PC, with your favorite editor/IDE.
* Some robots may need much more computational power than what EV3 can give
  you. A notable example is the Rubics cube solver: there is an algorithm that
  provides almost optimal solution (in terms of number of cube rotations), but
  it takes more RAM than is available on EV3. With RPYC, you could run the
  heavy-duty computations on your desktop.

The most obvious *disadvantage* is latency introduced by network connection.
This may be a show stopper for robots where reaction speed is essential.
