class LegoPort(Device):
    """
    The `lego-port` class provides an interface for working with input and
    output ports that are compatible with LEGO MINDSTORMS RCX/NXT/EV3, LEGO
    WeDo and LEGO Power Functions sensors and motors. Supported devices include
    the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Intelligent Brick, the LEGO WeDo USB hub and
    various sensor multiplexers from 3rd party manufacturers.

    Some types of ports may have multiple modes of operation. For example, the
    input ports on the EV3 brick can communicate with sensors using UART, I2C
    or analog validate signals - but not all at the same time. Therefore there
    are multiple modes available to connect to the different types of sensors.

    In most cases, ports are able to automatically detect what type of sensor
    or motor is connected. In some cases though, this must be manually specified
    using the `mode` and `set_device` attributes. The `mode` attribute affects
    how the port communicates with the connected device. For example the input
    ports on the EV3 brick can communicate using UART, I2C or analog voltages,
    but not all at the same time, so the mode must be set to the one that is
    appropriate for the connected sensor. The `set_device` attribute is used to
    specify the exact type of sensor that is connected. Note: the mode must be
    correctly set before setting the sensor type.

    Ports can be found at `/sys/class/lego-port/port<N>` where `<N>` is
    incremented each time a new port is registered. Note: The number is not
    related to the actual port at all - use the `address` attribute to find
    a specific port.
